# Django Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Django projects that I’m building as part of my learning journey with the Django web framework.

Each project demonstrates a core concept or feature of Django, such as routing, views, models, forms, admin, authentication, and more. I’m using this repo to practice, experiment, and grow my skills as a Django developer.
